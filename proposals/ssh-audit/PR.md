# Verify source signatures with openpgpverify

This switches the upstream source signature check from `%gpgverify` (GnuPG `gpgv`) to `%openpgpverify` (Sequoia `sqv`), as part of the Fedora 45 Change [Sequoia openpgpverify](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Sequoia_openpgpverify). The macro takes the same options, so the call itself only changes its name.

Why `sqv`:

- It is a verifier made for exactly this job: no home directory, trust database or default keyring, so only the keyring in the spec counts.
- It follows the system crypto policy and checks that the signing key was valid and correctly bound when the signature was made.
- It supports the current OpenPGP standard (RFC 9580, including v6 keys and signatures) and post-quantum (ML-DSA) signatures.
- It is the same OpenPGP implementation that rpm uses for package signatures in Fedora.

### Changes

- `%gpgverify` → `%openpgpverify` (1 call; the macro keeps the same form and options)
- added `BuildRequires: openpgpverify`; nothing pulls it into the buildroot implicitly (gpgverify comes in via redhat-rpm-config)
- Release bumped (`9%{?dist}` → `10%{?dist}`) with a changelog entry

### Testing

The current and the changed spec were both run through `rpmbuild -bp` in a clean mock chroot without network access (fedora-rawhide-x86_64). Every call of the verification tool was logged:

| Spec | Verification calls | Result |
|---|---|---|
| current (`%gpgverify`) | 1 | pass |
| this PR (`%openpgpverify`) | 1 | pass |

Tested on 2026-10-09 at dist-git commit `fd20ad5afeee` with sequoia-sqv 1.5.0-2.fc45.x86_64 (Fedora DEFAULT crypto policy).

### Notes

- Rawhide only. Whether to merge it into other branches is up to you; openpgpverify is in Fedora 43 and later, but not in EPEL yet, so please keep `%gpgverify` on EPEL branches.
- `BuildRequires: gnupg2` is kept: the spec has a `%check` section or uses gpg elsewhere, and tests may need it. If it was only there for the signature check, it can go too.
- Nothing changes in the built packages, so this doesn't need a build right away; the new check runs with your next build.
