Summary: slrn: source signature does not verify with openpgpverify (signing key algorithm rejected)

---

As part of the Fedora 45 Change [Sequoia openpgpverify](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Sequoia_openpgpverify), `%gpgverify` (GnuPG) is being replaced by `%openpgpverify` (Sequoia `sqv`). For slrn, the switch can't be done in a simple PR: the current check with `gpgv2` accepts the current upstream signature, but `%openpgpverify` rejects it.

Failing check (dist-git commit `80300b0556c6`):

```
%openpgpverify --keyring=slrn-gpgkeys.gpg --signature=slrn-1.0.3a.tar.bz2.asc --data=slrn-1.0.3a.tar.bz2
```

```
Error: Policy rejected packet type

Caused by:
    Signature Packet v3 is not considered secure since 2021-02-01T00:00:00Z
openpgpverify: Signature verification failed.
```

### Why

The spec already says so (`# sequoia does not support version 3 signature packet`); this bug tracks it for the Change.

Checked in full, not only the first error sqv reports: the release signature (v3, SHA-1, made 2016-10-24) is by key AE962A02D29BFE4A4BB2805FDE401E0D5873000A (DSA 1024 bits). The signature itself is rejected: it is in the version 3 format and it uses SHA-1. The key in dist-git: key algorithm rejected by the crypto policy (DSA-1024); the key's self-signatures use only SHA-1. The copy on keyservers/WKD has the same problems.

The release is signed with a key whose algorithm the crypto policy rejects (DSA, or RSA shorter than 2048 bits); for a signing subkey, its primary key counts too. Neither a new release signature nor new self-signatures with this key will help. (DSA-1024 can only use 160-bit hashes, which is also why such signatures are SHA-1.)

### What can be done

- Ask upstream to create a new key (for example Ed25519 or RSA 3072+), publish it, and sign releases with it using SHA-256 or better. Then switch the keyring to it.
- Until then the package can keep the current GnuPG check, or verify the tarball differently (for example against a checksum published over HTTPS).

The rest of the conversion is mechanical. Once the signature or key is sorted out, the spec change replaces the direct GnuPG call with one `%{openpgpverify}` call (same keyring, signature and data) and adds `BuildRequires: openpgpverify`; it is ready and tested up to the signature check. I'm happy to send the PR.

(The check was run with scripts from https://github.com/Jakuje/openpgpverify-migration.)
